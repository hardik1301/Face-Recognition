# Face-Recognition
The Project basically compares accuracy of two Machine learning Methods KNN & SVM used for Facial Recognition . 
The technique used for the purpose of Face Recognition is Principal Component Analysis(PCA) using Dimensionality Reduction .
The Dataset used is Olivetti Dataset.
SVM being a better approach than KNN gives better accuracy.  
Accuracies-
   KNN-59%
   SVM-95%
